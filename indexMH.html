  <h1>Applications of computing that make positive contributions to society</h1>
  <h2>Machine Learning </h2>
  <p>Machine Learning is allowing for the speed of solutions to problems within many different fields.
  From Physics and Mathematics to Biology and Industry, fields are getting revolutionised by the introduction of machine learning.

  In Biology we're seeing diseases such as sepsis be diagnosed much quicker and much more proficiently by machines,
  Machines trained on different genetic data can identify where the material has come from and its gene expression to get the expected patient response.
  Allowing for the differentiation of other diseases from sepsis in patients: <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-10-machine-enables-diagnosis-elusive-global.html"> Taken from here</a>

  In Industry, new metals are usually laboriously made by scientists with very common metals like iron and combinining them with more expensive metals to see the effects.
  But after training a machine learning model on hundreds of different metal alloys and their properties the model could then predict and suggest different combinations of metals
  to allow for production of useful properties. In this case invariability of size when temperatures are changed greatly. Metals can contract and expand due to heat and in industry.
  If a metal were to expand too much the system it is a part of could break down. This improvement speeds up the process of finding new alloys to be used in industry as the labour of 
  scientists is not as necessary for testing. The predictions are given and the tests are made from those predictions as opposed to blind trial and error: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/25/1062104/machine-learning-new-metals/"> Taken from here</a>
  
  In Physics our understanding of protons is being deepened with the introduction of Machine Learning.
  The speed of analysis of data provided has been sped up tremendously allowing for many quanitities to be processed at once.
  Usually analysis takes years, with the new machine learning tool OmniFold it takes minutes. And although processing multiple datapoints
  had been possible previously, it had not been able to account for distortions in the detector now that it can.
  The processing of data from these particle experiments has been much faster. <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/969015"> Taken from here</a>

  Mathematics has had its matrix multiplication speed increased with reinforcement learning. The efficiency of matrix multiplication has been increased
  shaving off 2 more multiplications from matrix multiplication reducing computation time.
  AlphaTensor was the network behind this discovery, although 2 steps may not seem like much, when millions of matrix multiplications are taking place
  2 multiplications add up much faster. The matrix multiplication was treated like a single player game and the goal given to the computer was to find the least possible
  steps to perform the full multiplication which it has succeeded at. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/deepmind-breaks-50-year-math-record-using-ai-new-record-falls-a-week-later/"> Taken from here</a>
