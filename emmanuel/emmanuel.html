              Just over 20 years ago, the dotcom bubble burst, causing the
              stocks of many tech firms to tumble. Some companies, like Amazon,
              quickly recovered their value – but many others were left in
              ruins. In the two decades since this crash, technology has
              advanced in many ways.

            Many more people are online today than they were at the start of the
            millennium. Looking at broadband access, in 2000, just half of
            Americans had broadband access at home. Today, that number sits at
            more than 90%.
          </p>

            <img src="/emmanuel/internet.png" alt="" class="col-md-6 h-50" />
            <div class="">
              <p class="mb-3">
                This broadband expansion was certainly not just an American
                phenomenon. Similar growth can be seen on a global scale; while
                less than 7% of the world was online in 2000, today over half
                the global population has access to the internet.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Similar trends can be seen in cellphone use. At the start of the
                2000s, there were 740 million cell phone subscriptions
                worldwide. Two decades later, that number has surpassed 8
                billion, meaning there are now more cellphones in the world than
                people.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                At the same time, technology was also becoming more personal and
                portable. Apple sold its first iPod in 2001, and six years later
                it introduced the iPhone, which ushered in a new era of personal
                technology. These changes led to a world in which technology
                touches nearly everything we do. Technology has changed major
                sectors over the past 20 years, including media, climate action
                and healthcare. The World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneers,
                which just celebrated its 20th anniversary, gives us insight how
                emerging tech leaders have influenced and responded to these
                changes.
