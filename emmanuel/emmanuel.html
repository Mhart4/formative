              Technology is progressing rapidly, and it is changing the way we
              live, work and play. New inventions are happening, and new
              paradigms are born almost every day. Conventional concepts we are
              used to as a human race for decades or even centuries are being
              disrupted by cutting edge technology.

                Charles Darwin proposed that evolution is the change in the
                characteristics of a species over several generations — which
                could happen over eons or within few centuries. This process of
                evolution relies on the process of natural selection. Charles’
                theory of evolution is based on the idea that all species
                gradually change over time. The complex process of evolution
                relies on there being a genetic variation in a population which
                affects the physical characteristics of an organism. Some of
                these characteristics may give the individual an advantage over
                other members of the same species which they can then pass on to
                their offspring. This process of continuously adopting
                advantageous characteristics by subsequent generations is called
                “natural selection.”
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Individuals who win the evolutionary lottery and have the
                characteristics best suited to their environment are more likely
                to survive, finding food, avoiding predators and resisting
                disease. These members of the species are more likely to
                reproduce and pass their genes on to their children. But the
                losers in this race that are poorly adapted to their environment
                are less likely to survive and reproduce. Therefore their genes
                are less likely to be passed on to the next generation.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                As a result, the individual members of a particular species who
                are most suited to their environment survive and, given enough
                time, the species will gradually evolve. Darwin termed this
                process “survival of the fittest.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though Darwin’s theory has been able to explain the
                evolutionary cycles of many species including homo sapiens — it
                seems like it is proving to be ineffective as of late especially
                when it comes to humans. And this phenomenon could be directly
                attributed to the increasing power of technology in the field of
                healthcare. Multiple deadly diseases have been completely
                eradicated by the use of sophisticated cures like anti-biotics.
                As a result, even the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us can
                live their lives relatively comfortably. In some case, they can
                also reproduce with advanced techniques like in vitro
                fertilization (IVF). So the phenomenon of the survival of the
                fittest is no longer at work here. Instead, the evolution is
                occurring in two other ways Efficiency-Based Transhumanism
