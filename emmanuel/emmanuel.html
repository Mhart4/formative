              Just over 20 years ago, the dotcom bubble burst, causing the
              stocks of many tech firms to tumble. Some companies, like Amazon,
              quickly recovered their value – but many others were left in
              ruins. In the two decades since this crash, technology has
              advanced in many ways.

            Many more people are online today than they were at the start of the
            millennium. Looking at broadband access, in 2000, just half of
            Americans had broadband access at home. Today, that number sits at
            more than 90%.
          </p>

            />
            <div class="">
              <p class="mb-3">
                This broadband expansion was certainly not just an American
                phenomenon. Similar growth can be seen on a global scale; while
                less than 7% of the world was online in 2000, today over half
                the global population has access to the internet.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Similar trends can be seen in cellphone use. At the start of the
                2000s, there were 740 million cell phone subscriptions
                worldwide. Two decades later, that number has surpassed 8
                billion, meaning there are now more cellphones in the world than
                people.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                At the same time, technology was also becoming more personal and
                portable. Apple sold its first iPod in 2001, and six years later
                it introduced the iPhone, which ushered in a new era of personal
                technology. These changes led to a world in which technology
                touches nearly everything we do. Technology has changed major
                sectors over the past 20 years, including media, climate action
                and healthcare. The World Economic Forum’s Technology Pioneers,
                which just celebrated its 20th anniversary, gives us insight how
                emerging tech leaders have influenced and responded to these
                changes.

                  The past 20 years have greatly shaped how and where we consume
                  media. In the early 2000s, many tech firms were still focused
                  on expanding communication for work through advanced bandwidth
                  for video streaming and other media consumption that is common
                  today.

                  Others followed the path of expanding media options beyond
                  traditional outlets. Early Tech Pioneers such as PlanetOut did
                  this by providing an outlet and alternative media source for
                  LGBTQIA communities as more people got online.

                  While these new online communities and communication channels
                  have offered great spaces for alternative voices, their
                  increased use has also brought issues of increased
                  disinformation and polarization.

                <p class="mb-3">
                  Today, many tech start-ups are focused on preserving these
                  online media spaces while also mitigating the disinformation
                  which can come with them. Recently, some Tech Pioneers have
                  also approached this issue, including TruePic – which focuses
                  on photo identification – and Two Hat, which is developing
                  AI-powered content moderation for social media.

                Many scientists today are looking to technology to lead us
                towards a carbon-neutral world. Though renewed attention is
                being given to climate change today, these efforts to find a
                solution through technology is not new. In 2001, green tech
                offered a new investment opportunity for tech investors after
                the crash, leading to a boom of investing in renewable energy
                start-ups including Bloom Energy, a Technology Pioneer in 2010.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                In the past two decades, tech start-ups have only expanded their
                climate focus. Many today are focuses on initiatives far beyond
                clean energy to slow the impact of climate change.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Different start-ups, including Carbon Engineering and Climeworks
                from this year’s Technology Pioneers, have started to roll out
                carbon capture technology. These technologies remove CO2 from
                the air directly, enabling scientists to alleviate some of the
                damage from fossil fuels which have already been burned.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Another expanding area for young tech firms today is food
                systems innovation. Many firms, like Aleph Farms and Air
                Protein, are creating innovative meat and dairy alternatives
                that are much greener than their traditional counterparts.
